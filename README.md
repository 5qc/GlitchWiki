# NOTE
This project is almost a year old and I plan on recreating this sometime soon (cause it's getting a lot of traction for like no reason). I've improved greatly in coding and I would really like to continue this project. Just give me some time.

# GlitchWiki
Welcome to **GlitchWiki**, a recreation of [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org) using absolutely no PHP! Obviously, this isn't exactly like MediaWiki, but it is very similar
in many ways. You can go to the documentation [here](https://glitchwiki-html.glitch.me).

The project is still in heavy development, and may take a few days to complete. There is currently no download link, however you are free to [remix this on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/glitchwiki-html) or download on GitHub. This GitHub repository is the template version, and the one on Glitch is the documentation.

## Story
This project was created on April 22, 2021 due to a forum post created on the [Glitch support](https://support.glitch.com) website asking if anyone has recreated or imported MediaWiki into [Glitch](https://glitch.com). I ([roc0ast3r](https://glitch.com/@r0)) took that literally and decided to recreate MediaWiki within Glitch.

However, you can't really put PHP in a Glitch project (and also I don't know how to code PHP), so I scrapped PHP from the entire MediaWiki creation and made it all without PHP (and file extensions you can put in Glitch), and named it **GlitchWiki** because of the website it was made on.
